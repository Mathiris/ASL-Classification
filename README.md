# American Sign Language-Classification

The aim of the project is to classify letters made in American Sign Language, our dataset is from Kaggle on this <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/grassknoted/asl-alphabet" target="_blank">link</a> 
It has been slightly modified to take into account only the letters of the alphabet (in the code we remove the space and the deletion). 
The goal of the project is to discover image classification with deep learning, here convolutional neural networks. 
<p>
In this project, the dataset is very clean, the classes are balanced, we will see in another case study how to manage these particular cases
